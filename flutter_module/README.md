# Kkobak Flutter Module

This directory contains a minimal Flutter module used in the app. It serves as an example of how Flutter can be integrated for additional UI screens.

To build this module, install Flutter on your system and run:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter build aar
```

The resulting AAR can then be included in the Android project.
